# Parking-Lot-Management-System
This project is a simple Parking Lot Management System that allows users to park and unpark vehicles in a parking lot. The system keeps track of the available parking spaces and can issue parking tickets when a vehicle is parked and also provides the userâ€™s vehicle fare based on the hours spent in the parking lot.
